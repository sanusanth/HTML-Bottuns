&lt;input> elements of type button are rendered as simple push buttons, which can be programmed to control custom functionality anywhere on a webpage as required when assigned an event handler function (typically for the click event).

# <input type="button"> elements have no default behavior (their cousins, <input type="submit"> and <input type="reset"> are used to submit and reset forms, respectively). To make buttons do anything, you have to write JavaScript code to do the work.
# Buttons are for triggering actions. When do you use the <button> element? A good rule is to use a button when there is “no meaningful href.” Here’s another way to think of that: if clicking it doesn’t do anything without JavaScript, it should be a <button>.

A <button> that is within a <form>, by default, will submit that form. But aside from that, button elements don’t have any default behavior, and you’ll be wiring up that interactivity with JavaScript.
